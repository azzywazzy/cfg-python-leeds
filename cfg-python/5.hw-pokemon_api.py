# In this session you used the Pokemon API to retrieve a single Pokemon. I want a program that can
# retrieve multiple Pokemon and save their names and moves to a file.
# Use a list to store about 6 Pokemon IDs. Then in a for loop call the API to retrieve the data for each
# Pokemon. Save their names and moves into a file called 'pokemon.txt'
